## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Product type`: Type of product.
- `SKU`: Stock Keeping Unit identifier.
- `Price`: Price of the product.
- `Availability`: Availability status of the product.
- `Number of products sold`: Number of units sold.
- `Revenue generated`: Total revenue generated from sales.
- `Customer demographics`: Demographic information of customers.
- `Stock levels`: Current stock levels.
- `Lead times`: Lead time for restocking.
- `Order quantities`: Quantities ordered by customers.
- `Shipping times`: Time taken for shipping.
- `Shipping carriers`: Carriers used for shipping.
- `Shipping costs`: Costs incurred for shipping.
- `Supplier name`: Name of the supplier.
- `Location`: Location of the supplier or warehouse.
- `Lead time`: Overall lead time in the supply chain.
- `Production volumes`: Volumes of production.
- `Manufacturing lead time`: Time taken for manufacturing.
- `Manufacturing costs`: Costs incurred in manufacturing.
- `Inspection results`: Results from quality inspections.
- `Defect rates`: Rates of defects found in products.
- `Transportation modes`: Modes of transportation used.
- `Routes`: Shipping routes used.

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Building models to forecast sales, optimize stock levels, and reduce lead times.
6. **Optimization**: Implementing optimization techniques to improve supply chain efficiency.
7. **Visualization**: Creating dashboards and visualizations to present findings.

## Results
Key findings and results from the analysis and modeling will be presented here. This section can include visualizations, charts, and summary statistics to highlight important insights.
