# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my data science projects, each demonstrating my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Here you'll find detailed project descriptions, well-documented code, and insightful analyses, all aimed at solving real-world problems.

## Projects Included

### 1. Predictive Modeling
Building robust predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast outcomes and trends.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Uncovering hidden patterns and insights from complex datasets through thorough EDA techniques.

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Analyzing and interpreting textual data to extract meaningful information.

### 4. Data Visualization
Creating compelling visualizations to effectively communicate data-driven insights.

## Project Structure

Each project includes:
